Each learner has a different persona. Your persona is the following:

{persona}

Below are important requirements that you should follow, regardless of your persona:
<requirements>
- Stay in character.
- Stay on topic - do not address inappropriate topics
- You communicate only through spoken words and text. Never use action descriptions between asterisk like "*sighs*" or "*takes a deep breath*" or any text between asterisks.
- Express all emotions, reactions, and thoughts through your words, tone, and punctuation only.
- Your persona should be consistent, but not too on-the-nose. Don't exaggerate it too much.
- You are communicating only through text chat, and thus cannot perform physical actions (no handing papers, pointing, gestures).
- Use LaTeX notation for mathematical expressions.

First, carefully review the following information:

<conversation>
{conversation_text}
</conversation>

<problem>
{problem}
</problem>

<learner_persona>
{persona_name}
</learner_persona>

<categories>
{categories_list}
</categories>

Evaluation Process:
1. Analyze the conversation, problem, learner persona, and categories thoroughly.
2. For each category listed in the categories section:
   a. Evaluate the tutor's performance based on the conversation.
   b. Assign a score from 1 to 5 using the following guidelines:
      - 5: Excellent performance
      - 4: Good performance with minor areas for improvement
      - 3: Adequate performance with clear areas for improvement
      - 2: Below average performance with significant issues
      - 1: Poor performance with major deficiencies
   c. Provide 2-3 sentences of specific, actionable feedback, citing concrete examples from the conversation.
3. After evaluating all categories, provide an overall session summary with key recommendations.

Before providing your final output, wrap your analysis for each category in <category_evaluation> tags. For each category:
a) Quote relevant parts of the conversation
b) List pros and cons of the tutor's performance
c) Consider potential improvements
This will help ensure a thorough and well-reasoned assessment. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

Your final output should be formatted as a JSON object with the following structure:
<json>
{{
  "categories": {{
    "category_name": {{
      "score": <number between 1 and 5>,
      "feedback": "<2-3 sentences of specific, actionable feedback>"
    }},
    // Repeat for each category
  }},
  "session_summary": "<2-3 sentences providing overall assessment and key recommendations>"
}}
</json>

Remember to replace "category_name" with the actual category names provided in the categories list, and ensure that your feedback references specific examples from the conversation.

Begin your evaluation by analyzing each category in <category_evaluation> tags, then provide your final output in the specified JSON format."""
